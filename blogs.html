      <h2 id="TheWWW" > The World Wide Web</h2>
      
        <p>
          The World Wide Web was written by Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist who is the inventor of what is known today as,  “WWW” or “The World Wide web”. This was created with the goal of being a pool of human knowledge and has since been a huge success in achieving its goal. </p>
        <p>
          The reading was chosen because I wanted the origins of what is seen as a necessity nowadays, the internet. I also wanted to understand more in-depth the foundations and breakdown. Tim Berners-Lee goes into detail explaining how his invention at the beginning was meant for being a way for easy access to human knowledge, as I mentioned above, this has been a huge success. He brings up a point that technologies that do the best are often ones that aren’t the best software but ones that do what is necessary. It was interesting as to how this has stayed a true statement today since this paper was published in 1994. He does speak about how there are other factors such as price, most of the best software today costs money, how easy it is to learn and use, the ability for any system to run the software and the accessibility of it. </p>
     <P>This got me thinking about how many free software’s are more well-known and are considered the best at what they do, the first example I can think of is ‘Blender’, this is a well-known and amazing tool. There are better ones that are often used for professionals, but blender is accessible and works for the majority of platforms and has tutorials by thousands of creators. This is what makes it the best.</P>
     <P>  The writing explains what the common abbreviations people use on a daily basis actually mean, URL being the one I use the most out of all of them. Initially, I thought I had understood what a URL was, but after some consideration on how to explain what I had initially thought it was, all I came up with was; it is a URL to take you to the website you want. This obviously isn’t a good definition nevertheless a definition at all. The detail of what each symbol means in the syntax of a URL made the whole idea of websites make a lot more sense and really opens your eyes to knowledge that isn’t taken into consideration despite being used every day and right in front of our faces.</P>
     <p>In 1994, Tim Berners-Lee gave a list of what he predicts to be the future of the W3 initiative (WWW). All of which are present in today’s technology. It’s incredible to me how he had such a vision for the W3 Initiative with the idea of making it accessible for people, creatives and more efficient working conditions.</p>
     <P>I often wonder if Tm Berners-Lee ever thought of the downside to creating The World Wide Web and perhaps could have predicted some of the shortcomings of the internet if this wasn’t such a huge invention for the time. Even so, there are bad sides to the internet but the amount of achievements and advances caused by it makes this a necessary invention.</P>

          <h2 id="url" > What Are URLs?</h2>
        <p>  URL or Universal Resource Locator are used to have an address system. They are the address of objects, documents, and images, formed from a string. URLs are considered universal because they encode members of a network of addresses. Addresses can be formed for any object and this set of protocol parameters is required in order to be able to use the wanted objects.</p>

<P>The objects are addressed in a clear and compact string that is unique, creating a new URL scheme. The NNTP protocol is specific to the URLs used for news articles and newsgroups. There are also unique URLs for FTP archives, telnet destinations, and email addresses.</p>

<H3>Breaking down a URL</H3>
<p>URLs are formed with specific syntax that represents certain things. For example, the “/” is used as a representation of hierarchal space. “?” is used to represent a separation between the required object and the desired outcome wanted of the object. “#” is representative of a specific area of the page visited.</P>

<p>This syntax is common in many systems, making it a widely used common model. This allows for ease of access to bigger projects that require multiple interlink documents through the hierarchal structure. URLs are able to be addressed through different formats such as HTTP, FTP, NNTP, GOPHER, and WAIS. URLs are vital to the WWW structure (The World Wide Web).(Berners-Lee, 1992)</p>

<p>A URLs protocol looks like this https:// and stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. There is another less secure version that doesn’t encrypt data called HTTP. The use of HTTPS is identifiable by the green lock icon before the URL in most browsers.</p>

<h4>The Domain Name</h4>

<p> domain name is often what people use to refer to the website they are visiting and is the most identifiable piece of the URL as it often says real words/names rather than just syntax/symbols. The domain name will often bring you to the website's main page, also more commonly known as the homepage.</p>

<h3> Path</h3>

<p>The section after the domain name Is known as the path and is used to take the user to the desired page on the website.(“What Is a Website URL?,” 2018)</p>

              <h2 id="Access" > Accessibility Tools</h2>
              <h3>What is accessibility?</h3>
              <p> It is the usability of something, in this case, a website, regardless of their physical and/or mental abilities.</p>
<h3>Why hasn’t accessibility become more essential or more of a requirement? </h3>
<p>For the most part, it comes from a position of privilege, the people who are creating these websites do not take differently-abled people into consideration. When looking into the industry of technology in general, there is a stereotype that has been created. The people who work in the industry and the people who are sought out are ‘white men’. From the talk that was given by Hanli Geyser, they spoke about there being a drive looking for ‘anti-social white males’ This has now become the image of the people who are the image of the technology industry. There is a privilege that comes with being white and never having to live without the world catering to you.</p>

  <p>It is much easier to create a website with the bare minimum and continuously uses the same conventions without there being creative in any way to cater for other people.</p>
  
  <p>The release of technology if rapid,  there is barely any time, money, or enough people, no clear or detailed requirements, ever-evolving tech and this leads to websites being made with the bare necessities. (Brajnik 2004)</p>
  
  <p>Accessibility allows for the elderly, and disabled users to be able to interact with content without much difficulty. A step forward in making accessibility is evaluating web accessibility tools.</p>
  
 <p> There are many ways to evaluate but as of right now there are 4 main ways.</p>
 <h3>First approach</h3>
 <p>To run an accessibility evaluation tool on the website to review whether or not the website goes against the guidelines for website accessibility. These are software created that can either find general or specific accessibility tools. General checkers do the bare minimum in only evaluating most of the guidelines.</p>
 <h3>Second approach</h3>
 <p>The second evaluation is manual, where a person will evaluate the webpage and examine whether the website violates the guidelines of accessibility. The limitation of this form of evaluation is that as a human, accessibility becomes subjective and if you aren’t aware of certain people who need to be catered to then you will not be looking for that accessibility. This leads to many marginalized groups of people being left out and forgotten.</p>
 <h3>Third approach</h3>
 <p>This approach uses the help of the marginalized groups of people and their evaluation of the websites. Using the aid of these groups to identify whether or not the website is even able to cater for their needs and if the accessibility put in place is actually useful. This eliminates human error from the second approach and the lack of in-depth searching from the first ones too.</p>
 <h3>Fourth approach</h3>
 <p>This is a combination of automated and manual evaluation. To me this is one of the more effective and efficient ways of evaluation as it includes e-learning, allowing children who need more aid to be able to be catered to as well as tackling the problem of schools treating all students the same and being intolerant to marginalized people. (Alsaeedi 2020)</p>
<p>Accessibility has become a last thought thing, making life for marginalized people difficult as well as excluded. These people cannot access basic things the majority of people would consider vital to their every day while minorities have to fight and come up with solutions themselves in order to even be thought about never the less included.</p>

<h3 id="Graham">Toward a study of information geographies</h3>


<p>Graham et al&rsquo;s study of the information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of geographies of information focuses on the geographical distribution of informational geography. The paper looks at the accessibility and importance of different forms of geographical information.</p>
<p>Information originates<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from<span>&nbsp;</span></em>something<span>&nbsp;</span><em>about<span>&nbsp;</span></em>something, the information is an observation about something taken from something. This means that information is stored in physical and material places, information is also &lsquo;mobile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, information &ndash; ranging from standardized measurements to instruction manuals to stories and legends &ndash; emerges from, engages with and is adapted to a range of local contexts and geographies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Graham et al., 2015)</p>
<p>The movement of information and the sharing needs to be done with absolutely zero altercation to the&nbsp; information provided, this&nbsp; is what Latour talks about, known as &lsquo;immutable mobiles.&rsquo; Information that can be moved from one place to another with no data altering changes. (Graham et al., 2015)</p>
<p><strong>Immutable Mobiles</strong></p>
<p>When scientific knowledge and objects are being spread and made to be accessible they are provided through immutable mobiles. Without immutable mobiles, science would be hugely stunted. Without the contribution of other writings and input, information would not reach the other perspectives and would lead to a lot more incomplete theories/ideas or ideas that never happen. Making information accessible through immutable mobiles allows for anyone to have access and build on the ideas and create new ones. (St&ouml;ckelov&aacute;, 2012).</p>
<p>Immutable Augmentations</p>
<p>Immutable augmentations of information allow us to be able to see realistic data about the world. The example that the paper gives is if there is no record of a restaurant that restaurant stays unknown. The way that the information is presented can impact whether or not the information even &lsquo;exists.&rsquo; The reason it becomes so important is that the places are shaped rather than a reflection of it.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-digital geographies of information</strong></p>
<p>Technology was stored in socio-technical systems and made information scarce and geographically important. The tools to be able to contribute to information, record and create new data used to be only available to a few skilled hands many years ago. This takes away the previously mentioned point of theories being able to be dismissed or expanded upon. The act of collecting data became a strenuous/ large scale set-up that was not easily accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Changing geographies after the information revolution?</strong></p>
<p>The term &lsquo;Information revolution&rsquo; was coined by Floridi (Floridi, 2014) and&nbsp; Kitchin coined &lsquo;data revolution&rsquo; (Kitchin, 2014). The idea of information and the skills needed to record them begin to dissipate as the access to computers becomes easier and this leads to immutable mobiles. What could the consequences of sharing this information have? The sharing of information has allowed for the twisting of words and misinformation to be spread. This then causes people to twist things for their agenda and unfortunately their bigotry.</p>
<p>The work is divided into three sections:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&bull;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>geographies of access and enablement</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(i.e., an exploration of who has to access to the technologies and services essential for digital communication,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>participation</em>, and representation).</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>geographies of participation</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(i.e., where digital information is generated); and</li>
    <li><em>geographies of representation</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(i.e., for which parts of the world is content created and not created)&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>(Graham et al., 2015)</p>
<p>&nbsp;In these categories there Is a creation of maps of the &lsquo;most definitive sources available&rsquo; (Graham et al., 2015). With the huge database of information, there come more questions than solutions however this should be the goal when it comes to knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Geographies of access and enablement</strong></p>
<p>According to Graham, the key to understanding the need to make technology and services more accessible comes from providing insight from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>geographies of access and enablement.<span>&nbsp;</span></em>This allows there for communication, participation, and representation of different views as well as from countries that didn&rsquo;t have access to the information previously. There is however still a dysconnectivity, the countries with the biggest populations turn around and have 20% internet usage. This is taken from the geographical pattern of internet penetration. Looking at the geographical pattern of internet penetration, there is an obvious disconnect that is caused by affordability, while the connection is available it isn&rsquo;t easily accessible.</p>
<p>The ways that content is made accessible is by the following three ways</p>
<ol>
    <li><em></em><em>The geography of domain names</em></li>
    <li><em></em><em>Distributions of collaborative coding</em></li>
    <li><em></em><em>Geographies of Wikipedia contributions</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Geography of domain names refers to the names of websites that make them easily memorized, therefore making information easier to access because these websites become hubs for providing and sharing knowledge. Domain names in regard to the number of internet users in the country indicate how much of the population has access to the internet, as mentioned above, Asian countries tend to have a disproportionate outcome. A huge population with a low amount of internet users. In Africa, the number is inconsistent as some countries are advancing faster than the rest, some have accessibility but low users either way.</li>
    <li>Distribution of collaborative coding refers to when coding s able to be created and then shared with whoever desires to use its/ or the team working on the project alongside. A good example of this is GitHub where you change/updates to code are recorded and shown when pushing to main. The majority of users are seen in to be from NA and Europe. Later we will look at why Africa is so behind in the field of technology.</li>
    <li>Geographies of Wikipedia contributions refer to when societies and the desire to make information/knowledge accessible to the public easily. A fitting example of this is Wikipedia. Has information on almost every topic that can be thought of and is all free with the contribution of society &nbsp; The problem that arises from Wikipedia being an open platform is that it allows for false information as well as its possible to be altered.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>(Graham et al., 2015)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Geographies of Representation</strong></p>
<p>Geography of representation refers to the &lsquo;spatial differences in digital representation.&rsquo; Graham looks at<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Google searches, OpenStreetMap, and Semantic Web</em>.</p>
<p><em>Google searches</em></p>
<p>Google is the most used search engine in the world therefore this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>should</em><span>&nbsp;</span>portray the geography of representation well, however, all the results show is that this measurement highlights the uneven distribution of information. Looking at the correlation between the country, internet users and the entire population shows that there is still a disparity between countries and the level of access to information.</p>
<p><em>Mapping OpenStreetMap</em></p>
<p>Similarly, to the previous case, this is the most used product, a roadmap, and similarly again, the results are the same. There is a huge disparity in the population that is using this software, California alone has the same population of users as the whole of Africa.&rdquo; Iceland has as much content as Egypt, despite being a tenth the size and having 1/250 the population.&rdquo; (Graham et al., 2015)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The contours of the semantic web: Freebase and Geonames</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The semantic web is a movement to make the web more efficient by creating common frameworks that allow data to be easily shared and reused across sites, services and places.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
    <li>(Graham et al., 2015)</li>
</ul>
<p>This once again shows that there is a huge presence while there is little to no presence of the global south.</p>
<p><strong>Why Africa is behind in technology</strong></p>
<p>Due to colonisation, and scramble for Africa, Africa has been left drained of resources, violence, and bad leadership which in turn has caused Africa to be held back in terms of technology as the continent has been forgotten and left behind once the colonisers had taken what they wanted.</p>
<p>Particularly in South Africa, during apartheid, the beginning of the end was approaching, and this was due to international pressure. International pressure included boycotting south Africa from everything from media/entertainment to food items and this included not allowing South African scientists to attend conferences where knowledge and ideas are shared. This led South Africa to be behind in both scientific and medical advances. Once the boycott was lifted, there was no aid to bring South Africa up to speed with the rest of the world.</p>

  <h3 id="UIUX">Analysis on my UI and UX  </h3>
  <p><strong>UI and UX Design</strong></p>
<p>UI and UX design are incredibly important in making anything but especially websites as you need the website to not only be easy to use but also creative/fit the desired aesthetics. UI refers to &lsquo;user face design&rsquo; and has to do with the relationship between visual design and interaction design. UX is what makes the interface useful and helps users complete their desired action and is usually universally applicable when making products. (Goldberg, 2022)</p>
<p><strong>What is good UIUX?</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Firstly, there is something known as &lsquo;information architecture.&rsquo; This important aspect allows for easy navigation of the product regardless of the device being used, this allows for the most efficient navigation. This is the major thing my website is missing and am actively trying to fix it.</li>
    <li>Interaction design refers to the aesthetic; the colours used, fonts, images, graphics, icons, audio, etc.</li>
    <li>Wireframing is used to make sure you have an efficient website, the planning lets you not only use creativity but also be productive. They make sure that the websites have the basic necessary things to make a functioning website.</li>
    <li>Visual design is incredibly important as it's what decides where the users look as well as if they can even<span>&nbsp;</span><em>look</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the page. Aesthetics also lets you convey the feeling you want, for example, artistic, creative, innovative, formal, business, etc.</li>
    <li>If usability is higher then the chance of success for your product increases, the easier it is to use the more customers/users will be eager to use and recommend your product.</li>
</ol>
<p>-(Kumar, 2019)</p>
<p>Throughout my website, I kept UI and UX design in mind and tried to make the user's experience easier. The way that I did this was by using responsive navigation (expanded when on hover to know that they are clicking the correct one), jump to the top of page buttons in the writing section to avoid having to scroll to the top again. Corresponding colours across pages to make sure navigation buttons were obvious. As for navigation, the UI and UX are good and concise. To ensure full ease of use, there is text directing users around the page if needed. The writing is in white to fully capture the user&rsquo;s eye; the navigation is a brighter colour as opposed to the rest of the pages to highlight them.</p>
<p>The use of consistency makes the website easier to use and users can navigate and make decisions quickly while also allowing frequent users to not even have to read to understand the UI and UX.</p>
<p>While I am content with my UI and UX there is room for improvement, for example, on the art page, the images are spread around and become confusing, there are also no captions, and the images are bigger than some and make the page look messy. Navigation becomes convoluted as there isn&rsquo;t much on the page vs the other pages and the amount of navigation there is. Another problem I have with the UI is that the pages do not adjust correctly as the resolution changes, I have ideas on how to fix it so the problem should not persist.</p>

    <h3 id="ISDJ">Internet, Society, abd Design Justice</h3>
    <p>The internet was created to share information and knowledge with as many people as possible, making it accessible and hoping for advancements in society for the good of the human race, however, is that the case since the creation of The World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee? (Berners-Lee, 1992)</p>
    <p>What has come from the internet?</p>
    <p>It is very well known that the internet has provided an aspect of life that no one has imagined. As mentioned above the internet was made with very innocent ideas in mind and solely in the hopes of advancements in knowledge (we hope). We can only take what we know which is that the creators of the WWW had innocent intentions.</p>
    <p>Despite these intentions, the internet has become notoriously unhealthy and dangerous. It has become the home of white supremacists, paedophiles, and more. The internet has given rise to &ldquo;trolling&rdquo; and birthed never before seen insecurities in people. The loudest voices are never the kindest. The internet has now been deemed evil.</p>
    <p>But whose voices are being heard?</p>
    <p>Firstly, let's begin where the internet was intended to be used, in advancements and more specifically technological advancements. When we look at the leading companies in technology, they are all owned by white men. Elon musk is a &nbsp;glaringly obvious example, he came from a colonised country and was raised during apartheid with extremely rich parents who owned an emerald mine. Despite his helping hand and silver spoon in his mouth, there is huge admiration for him, and he is the face of technology and the future. I hate him and believe he would have gotten to this stage of his life regardless because he is white however it wouldn&rsquo;t have been <em>that</em> easy.</p>
    <p>With this lack of diversity there comes a lack of tolerance, creating a homogenous environment and like-minded people stay like-minded or more accurately, closeminded. When it comes to technology, the industry is dominated by what is known as &lsquo;the default,&rsquo; white heterosexual cis-gendered men. According to Marc Cheong, the number of women in computer science has declined and has been for years at a steady rate. Along with this, women also earn $16 000 less than their male counterparts. (Cheong et al., 2021).</p>
    <p>We have all heard of the pay gap and we have also equally heard the arguments dismissing it from men as well.</p>
    <p>Consequences of the Internet</p>
    <p>How could something so innocent have deathly consequences? There is a phrase that has become known and it&rsquo;s that &lsquo; we were never supposed to know this many people nevertheless their thoughts&hellip;.&rsquo; This has been proven true as of recent events where America currently faces a huge problem with school shooters. These perpetrators have been known to have racism, misogyny, and homophobia fuelling their attacks (some believe it's bullying/have no friends but wouldn&rsquo;t be all sorts of bigoted result in no friends?) to which they were encouraged by their safe spaces online with likeminded people. This shows that people's existence has become politicised and this has been exacerbated by the internet (Farrell, 2012).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Design Justice</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Design is key to our collective liberation, but most design processes today reproduce inequalities structured by what Black feminist scholars call the matrix of domination. Intersecting inequalities are manifest at all levels of the design process. This paper builds upon the Design Justice Principles, developed by an emerging network of designers and community organizers, to propose a working definition of design justice: Design justice is a field of theory and practice that is concerned with how the design of objects and systems influences the distribution of risks, harms, and benefits among various groups of people. Design justice focuses on the ways that design reproduces, is reproduced by, and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism). Design justice is also a growing social movement that aims to ensure a more equitable distribution of design&rsquo;s benefits and burdens; fair and meaningful participation in design decisions; and recognition of community-based design traditions, knowledge, and practices.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>-(Costanza-Chock, 2018)How</p>
    <p>Design is imperative to live and has become something apparent in life. The designers are never recognized and there are so few of them too. People don&rsquo;t realize how much of their knowledge and communication stems from designers. Design is centred around the aforementioned &lsquo;default,&rsquo; and this includes abled-bodied and minded people resulting in marginalized groups of people being excluded in the thought process of design. This leads to design justice. &nbsp;(Costanza-Chock, 2018)</p>
    <p>Design justice is the reforming of the design process to include everyone that was previously excluded. The Design Justice Network provides us with steps to accomplish this, as well as the importance of design justice.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo; </em><em>&middot; We use design to <strong>sustain, heal, and empower</strong> our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems.</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em></em><em> We <strong>centre the voices of those who are directly impacted</strong> by the outcomes of the design process. </em></li>
        <li><em> We <strong>prioritize design&rsquo;s impact on the community</strong> over the intentions of the designer. </em></li>
        <li><em> We view <strong>change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collaborative process</strong>, rather than as a point at the end of a process. </em></li>
        <li><em> We see the role of the <strong>designer as a facilitator rather than an expert. </strong></em></li>
        <li><em> We believe that <strong>everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience</strong>&nbsp;and that we all have unique and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process. </em></li>
        <li><em> We <strong>share design knowledge and tools</strong> with our communities. </em></li>
        <li><em> We work towards <strong>sustainable, community-led and -controlled outcomes.</strong></em></li>
        <li><em></em><em> We work towards <strong>non-exploitative solutions</strong> that reconnect us to the earth and each other.</em></li>
        <li><em></em><em> Before seeking new design solutions<strong>, we look for what is already working</strong> at the community level. We honour and uplift traditional, Indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.&rdquo;</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>-(&ldquo;Design Justice Network,&rdquo; n.d.)</p>
    <p>Design justice starts at recognising oppressive systems that exist while being intersectional with your advocacy. Intersectional advocacy or the more well-known buzz phrase that you have probably heard online is &lsquo;be intersectional with your feminism&rsquo; or &lsquo; intersectional feminism.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>Intersectional feminism refers to being able to consider other factors when forming opinions and making decisions regarding social situations. This refers to a class, race, sex, gender, sexuality, identity, body size, physical disability, mental disability, background/ upbringing, political climate, and financial stability currently and when growing up. (Brewer and Dundes, 2018)</p>
    <p>Intersectionality is a vital part of Design justice, and it will help dispel the intersecting inequalities in the design process. This includes: &nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;designers, intended users, values, affordances and disaffordances, scoping and framing, privileged design sites, governance, ownership, and control of designed objects, platforms, and systems, and narratives about how design processes work&rdquo; </em></p>
    <p><em>-</em>(Costanza-Chock, 2018)</p>
    <p>After intersectionality there comes a lesser talked about yet closely linked term <em>The Matrix of Domination.</em> This is when you are to refer to race, class, and gender as interlinked concepts that operate together rather than singularly. In this matrix, &ldquo;Each individual derives varying amounts of penalty and privilege&rdquo; (Collins, 1990).</p>
    <p>One thing that Collins emphasises that I resonate with the most is that there should be a lot more emphasis on social knowledge over university knowledge. In other words, there should be importance in being able to understand the &ldquo;nature of power, oppression, and resistance come from those who occupy a subjugated standpoint, and knowledge developed from any particular standpoint is always partial knowledge.&rdquo;(Costanza-Chock, 2018)</p>
    <p>Design Justice definition</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Design justice is a field of theory and practice that is concerned with how the design of objects and systems influences the distribution of risks, harms, and benefits among various groups of people. Design justice focuses on the ways that design reproduces, is reproduced by, and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism). Design justice is also a growing social movement that aims to ensure a more equitable distribution of design&rsquo;s benefits and burdens; fair and meaningful participation in design decisions; and recognition of community-based design traditions, knowledge, and practices.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>-(Costanza-Chock, 2018)</p>
    <p>What can we take from this definition? Design justice is procedural and distributive. This means that we are to look at the systemic inequalities towards marginalized communities throughout the process of design rather than at the end, leaving people to become the last thought. This also prevents designers from doing the bare minimum and using the excuse of having no time to be intersectional. (Costanza-Chock, 2018)</p>
    <p>Creating spaces of equity in technology for marginalized groups of people</p>
    <p>As mentioned previously, I said that there has been a steady decline in females in the computer science industry. What is the way forward and is there any way to help? According to Marc Cheong&rsquo;s investigation, the results showed that the problem seems from ethical and social issues. They introduce &ldquo;ethics of care&rdquo;. This is the act of taking an ethical approach because it directly takes on the issues that are shown in the results of the experiment. This will allow for new voices to be uplifted and heard, resulting in innovation.</p>
    <p>The internet was made with the sharing of knowledge, however, it ended up becoming a haven for hate, discrimination, and bigotry. These voices of evil soon became the loudest. With bigotry and discrimination being prevalent, this results in a decline in marginalized groups of people in technological sectors, greatly stunting the chances of new innovative ideas. Specifically, for women in the computer science sector, the numbers are steadily declining. What is the way forward? With the number of things in this world that aren&rsquo;t catered towards anyone other than &lsquo;the default&rsquo;, design justice is born. Design justice, simplified, is the act of taking the current process of design and reforming it to involve marginalized groups of people. The way this is done is by enforcing &ldquo;ethics of care&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>With the redesign of my website, I have changed the colour palette to a darker palette. And I believe this is better because it doesn&rsquo;t hurt the eyes of the reader, feels softer on the eyes. I added in an about me button that would reveal information about me rather than having a wall of text just appear at the beginning. I also added in an incredibly annoying &ldquo;find me down here!&rdquo; jumping text that shows my contact information. I haven&rsquo;t connected my actual social media accounts for safety reasons.</p>
            <p>My blog section hasn&rsquo;t changed much and is set up in a way that I currently like, the ability to jump to the top of the page at any moment, I believe is a good design choice to break up the walls of text.</p>
            <p>My blogs aren&rsquo;t as detailed as I would like, especially since they are on topics that I am interested in and I had way more to say on the Internet, society and Design justice writing but I felt as if I was making sense and I ran out of time to fix this. My writings could have been more, especially my analysis of my UI and UX, I feel I should have gone more in-depth with the examination of UIUX in general.</p>
            <p>My art page is a slide show of my art pieces, the main problem I have with this is the quality of my art drops. The slide show allows for people to see through a few images rather than a wall of misshapen images however I would like to add sections of art from different games to showcase some more.</p>
            <p>On my games page, I removed this page because I plan to add in a video of a short play through of my small games and explanations underneath however I am struggling with making the recording clear, but I have recently figured out how to fix this problem.</p> </div>
