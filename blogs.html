      <h2 id="TheWWW" > The World Wide Web</h2>
      
        <p>
          The World Wide Web was written by Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist who is the inventor of what is known today as,  “WWW” or “The World Wide web”. This was created with the goal of being a pool of human knowledge and has since been a huge success in achieving its goal. </p>
        <p>
          The reading was chosen because I wanted the origins of what is seen as a necessity nowadays, the internet. I also wanted to understand more in-depth the foundations and breakdown. Tim Berners-Lee goes into detail explaining how his invention at the beginning was meant for being a way for easy access to human knowledge, as I mentioned above, this has been a huge success. He brings up a point that technologies that do the best are often ones that aren’t the best software but ones that do what is necessary. It was interesting as to how this has stayed a true statement today since this paper was published in 1994. He does speak about how there are other factors such as price, most of the best software today costs money, how easy it is to learn and use, the ability for any system to run the software and the accessibility of it. </p>
     <P>This got me thinking about how many free software’s are more well-known and are considered the best at what they do, the first example I can think of is ‘Blender’, this is a well-known and amazing tool. There are better ones that are often used for professionals, but blender is accessible and works for the majority of platforms and has tutorials by thousands of creators. This is what makes it the best.</P>
     <P>  The writing explains what the common abbreviations people use on a daily basis actually mean, URL being the one I use the most out of all of them. Initially, I thought I had understood what a URL was, but after some consideration on how to explain what I had initially thought it was, all I came up with was; it is a URL to take you to the website you want. This obviously isn’t a good definition nevertheless a definition at all. The detail of what each symbol means in the syntax of a URL made the whole idea of websites make a lot more sense and really opens your eyes to knowledge that isn’t taken into consideration despite being used every day and right in front of our faces.</P>
     <p>In 1994, Tim Berners-Lee gave a list of what he predicts to be the future of the W3 initiative (WWW). All of which are present in today’s technology. It’s incredible to me how he had such a vision for the W3 Initiative with the idea of making it accessible for people, creatives and more efficient working conditions.</p>
     <P>I often wonder if Tm Berners-Lee ever thought of the downside to creating The World Wide Web and perhaps could have predicted some of the shortcomings of the internet if this wasn’t such a huge invention for the time. Even so, there are bad sides to the internet but the amount of achievements and advances caused by it makes this a necessary invention.</P>

          <h2 id="url" > What Are URLs?</h2>
        <p>  URL or Universal Resource Locator are used to have an address system. They are the address of objects, documents, and images, formed from a string. URLs are considered universal because they encode members of a network of addresses. Addresses can be formed for any object and this set of protocol parameters is required in order to be able to use the wanted objects.</p>

<P>The objects are addressed in a clear and compact string that is unique, creating a new URL scheme. The NNTP protocol is specific to the URLs used for news articles and newsgroups. There are also unique URLs for FTP archives, telnet destinations, and email addresses.</p>

<H3>Breaking down a URL</H3>
<p>URLs are formed with specific syntax that represents certain things. For example, the “/” is used as a representation of hierarchal space. “?” is used to represent a separation between the required object and the desired outcome wanted of the object. “#” is representative of a specific area of the page visited.</P>

<p>This syntax is common in many systems, making it a widely used common model. This allows for ease of access to bigger projects that require multiple interlink documents through the hierarchal structure. URLs are able to be addressed through different formats such as HTTP, FTP, NNTP, GOPHER, and WAIS. URLs are vital to the WWW structure (The World Wide Web).(Berners-Lee, 1992)</p>

<p>A URLs protocol looks like this https:// and stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. There is another less secure version that doesn’t encrypt data called HTTP. The use of HTTPS is identifiable by the green lock icon before the URL in most browsers.</p>

<h4>The Domain Name</h4>

<p> domain name is often what people use to refer to the website they are visiting and is the most identifiable piece of the URL as it often says real words/names rather than just syntax/symbols. The domain name will often bring you to the website's main page, also more commonly known as the homepage.</p>

<h3> Path</h3>

<p>The section after the domain name Is known as the path and is used to take the user to the desired page on the website.(“What Is a Website URL?,” 2018)</p>

              <h2 id="Access" > Accessibility Tools</h2>
              <h3>What is accessibility?</h3>
              <p> It is the usability of something, in this case, a website, regardless of their physical and/or mental abilities.</p>
<h3>Why hasn’t accessibility become more essential or more of a requirement? </h3>
<p>For the most part, it comes from a position of privilege, the people who are creating these websites do not take differently-abled people into consideration. When looking into the industry of technology in general, there is a stereotype that has been created. The people who work in the industry and the people who are sought out are ‘white men’. From the talk that was given by Hanli Geyser, they spoke about there being a drive looking for ‘anti-social white males’ This has now become the image of the people who are the image of the technology industry. There is a privilege that comes with being white and never having to live without the world catering to you.</p>

  <p>It is much easier to create a website with the bare minimum and continuously uses the same conventions without there being creative in any way to cater for other people.</p>
  
  <p>The release of technology if rapid,  there is barely any time, money, or enough people, no clear or detailed requirements, ever-evolving tech and this leads to websites being made with the bare necessities. (Brajnik 2004)</p>
  
  <p>Accessibility allows for the elderly, and disabled users to be able to interact with content without much difficulty. A step forward in making accessibility is evaluating web accessibility tools.</p>
  
 <p> There are many ways to evaluate but as of right now there are 4 main ways.</p>
 <h3>First approach</h3>
 <p>To run an accessibility evaluation tool on the website to review whether or not the website goes against the guidelines for website accessibility. These are software created that can either find general or specific accessibility tools. General checkers do the bare minimum in only evaluating most of the guidelines.</p>
 <h3>Second approach</h3>
 <p>The second evaluation is manual, where a person will evaluate the webpage and examine whether the website violates the guidelines of accessibility. The limitation of this form of evaluation is that as a human, accessibility becomes subjective and if you aren’t aware of certain people who need to be catered to then you will not be looking for that accessibility. This leads to many marginalized groups of people being left out and forgotten.</p>
 <h3>Third approach</h3>
 <p>This approach uses the help of the marginalized groups of people and their evaluation of the websites. Using the aid of these groups to identify whether or not the website is even able to cater for their needs and if the accessibility put in place is actually useful. This eliminates human error from the second approach and the lack of in-depth searching from the first ones too.</p>
 <h3>Fourth approach</h3>
 <p>This is a combination of automated and manual evaluation. To me this is one of the more effective and efficient ways of evaluation as it includes e-learning, allowing children who need more aid to be able to be catered to as well as tackling the problem of schools treating all students the same and being intolerant to marginalized people. (Alsaeedi 2020)</p>
<p>Accessibility has become a last thought thing, making life for marginalized people difficult as well as excluded. These people cannot access basic things the majority of people would consider vital to their every day while minorities have to fight and come up with solutions themselves in order to even be thought about never the less included.</p>

          <p> 
            Looking back at the writings I have provided for the critical writing assignments, the first one required a more in-depth analysis of the whole text rather than just the section I found interesting. I only wrote about the part of the paper I understood really well instead of engaging with the whole text and explaining my point of view of why I didn’t understand completely.</p>
<p> next two writings also could have been more in-depth and became somewhat of a research paper instead of analysing the content, I do like that I sought out more content on the topics and engaged with those writings.</p>
<p>The last analysis was a broad topic I was excited to write about and found extremely interesting, especially since the topic of marginalized groups of people being forgotten is important to me. I wish I had gone into much more detail considering I do have the knowledge and want to speak more on making life more accessible for everyone.</p>
